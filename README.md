This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## ü§ñ AI Credit Analysis

The system includes **automated AI credit analysis** for every credit application:

### What It Analyzes:
- **Company Information**: Legal entity, DBA, tax EIN, DUNS number
- **Contact Details**: Professional email formats, phone numbers
- **Address Verification**: Billing and shipping addresses (Note: AI checks formatting/completeness, but cannot perform live verification against a database)
- **Trade References**: Quality and completeness of references
- **Risk Assessment**: Missing data, red flags, inconsistencies

### AI Analysis Process:
1. üìù Customer submits application
2. ü§ñ **o3 model analyzes all application data with advanced reasoning**
3. üìß **Comprehensive credit report, including AI insights from the o3 model, emailed to Alliance Chemical**

The AI provides thorough B2B credit evaluation with decision recommendations, credit limits, payment terms, and risk levels using OpenAI's most advanced reasoning model.
