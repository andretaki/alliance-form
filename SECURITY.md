# üõ°Ô∏è Security Documentation - Alliance Chemical Application

## üìã Security Audit Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to protect the Alliance Chemical credit application system against modern web vulnerabilities.

### ‚úÖ Security Measures Implemented

#### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- **Signed URL Authentication**: Credit approval endpoints use cryptographically signed URLs with expiration
- **Token-based Authentication**: Admin endpoints require valid authentication tokens
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with HttpOnly cookies
- **Password Security**: PBKDF2 password hashing with 100,000 iterations

#### üö´ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Strict CSP headers blocking inline scripts and unsafe sources
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized using Zod schemas and custom sanitizers
- **Output Encoding**: HTML entities are properly encoded in responses
- **XSS Protection Headers**: X-XSS-Protection header enabled

#### üõ°Ô∏è SQL Injection Protection
- **ORM Usage**: Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries prevents SQL injection
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas validate all database inputs
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures type-safe database operations

#### üîí Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection
- **CSRF Tokens**: Generated and validated for all state-changing requests
- **SameSite Cookies**: Cookies configured with SameSite=Strict
- **Origin Validation**: Request origin and referer headers are validated

#### üåê Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Protection
- **URL Validation**: All external URLs are validated against private IP ranges
- **Allowed Domains**: Only specific external services (OpenAI, Microsoft Graph) are allowed
- **Request Timeout**: External requests have strict timeout limits

#### üìÅ File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: MIME type and file extension validation
- **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum file size
- **Content Scanning**: Basic malware signature detection
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in private S3 bucket with encryption
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Filename sanitization prevents directory traversal

#### üîÑ Rate Limiting
- **Per-IP Rate Limiting**: Different limits for different endpoint types
- **Sliding Window**: 1-minute sliding window for API endpoints
- **Graduated Responses**: 429 status codes with Retry-After headers

#### üèóÔ∏è Security Headers
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security (production only)
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY to prevent clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff to prevent MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to sensitive browser APIs

#### üìä Security Monitoring & Logging
- **Security Event Logging**: All security-related events are logged
- **Request Monitoring**: Suspicious requests are logged and flagged
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages prevent information disclosure
- **Audit Trail**: All database modifications are timestamped

## üîß Implementation Details

```typescript
// Implements:
- Rate limiting per IP and endpoint

- Secure filename generation
- Private S3 storage
```

### Credit Approval Security (`/api/credit-approval`)
```typescript
// Implements:
- Cryptographically signed URLs
- Time-based token expiration
- Request validation and logging
- Secure HTML responses
```
